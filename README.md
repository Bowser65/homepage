### What people think about homepage
*Google attempts to hide DuckDuckGo, so on Google Chrome, it's kinda hard to find DuckDuckGo without the right link. BUT WITH THE ALEXFLIPNOTE HOMEPAGE!*

### Adding backgrounds
1. Add image file as `.jpg` to `assets/backgrounds` directory with a filename
conforming to the rest of the image files (last index)
2. Bump the multiplier on line 47 of `assets/script.js` so the JavaScript can
see it
