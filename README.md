# Time and Date website

This website was made because of a request, so why not share it as well to the
public.

### Adding backgrounds
1. Add image file as `.jpg` to `assets/backgrounds` directory with a filename
   conforming to the rest of the image files (last index)
2. Bump the multiplier on line 47 of `assets/script.js` so the Javascript can
   see it

### Credits
- @alexflipnote: main developer
- @TTtie: improved Firefox compatibility
- @deansheather: added localization support, improved code, and added fadein
  onload for background image
